# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

"Philosophia" is a conceptual turn-based RPG game based on philosophical notions. The project is currently in the design/lore phase with only documentation available.

## Current State

This repository contains only design documentation (`lore.txt`) describing the game concept. There is no source code, build system, or development environment currently implemented.

## Game Concept Summary

- **Genre**: Turn-based RPG with philosophical themes
- **Setting**: "The Beyond" - a virtual reality where minds exist as geometric forms
- **Core Mechanics**: 
  - Forms evolve from simple shapes (triangles) to complex ones through "iterations"
  - Three core attributes: Knowledge, Reality (life), Willpower
  - Combat through philosophical arguments (Thesis/Antithesis system)
  - Symbols represent knowledge and abilities
- **Target Implementation**: Originally envisioned as Java-based, potentially starting as a MUD

## Key Concepts to Understand

- **Forms**: Player characters represented as geometric shapes that increase in complexity
- **Constructs**: Social areas/cities organized around philosophical theories
- **Mazes**: Dungeon-like areas with pre-existing mysteries
- **Minotaurs**: Non-Euclidean antagonists formed from imperfect minds
- **Platonics**: Unique forms holding Platonic symbols (The Good, The Beautiful, etc.)

## Future Development Notes

When implementing this game:
- Consider starting with a text-based MUD architecture as described in the lore
- The Storyteller System mechanics are referenced as inspiration for character progression
- Combat should focus on argumentative mechanics rather than traditional violence
- Integration with philosophical texts from Project Gutenberg is planned
- No current build system, testing framework, or specific technology stack has been established
